# Brain_Tumor_classification
 The objective of this project is to build a CNN-based system that performs binary classification on MRI brain images to detect the presence of tumors. In the early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors, it improves patient outcomes and treatment planning.  In this project, the integration of two distinct brain tumor datasets significantly contributes to advance the research and development endeavors. These datasets, namely the "Brian Tumor Dataset" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/brian-tumor-dataset?select=metadata.csv) , and "Br35H:: Brain Tumor Detection" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection) , both offer valuable resources for analysis and model training.  Machine learning , CNN and Python.
